        <h1>Social Anxiety Disorder</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is a mental health condition where everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness, and embarrassment due to fear of being judged negatively by others.</p>

        <p>Fear and anxiety can lead to avoidance, disrupting relationships, daily routines, work, school, or other activities. With treatment, such as psychotherapy and medication, people can improve their confidence and ability to interact with others.</p>
