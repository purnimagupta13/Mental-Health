        <h1>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by an extremely stressful or terrifying event â€” either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks.</p>
        
        <h3>Intrusive Memories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unwanted, distressing memories of a traumatic event that come back over and over again.</li>
            <li>Reliving a traumatic event as if it were happening again, also known as flashbacks.</li>
            <li>Upsetting dreams or nightmares about a traumatic event.</li>
            <li>Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of a traumatic event.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Avoidance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trying not to think or talk about a traumatic event.</li>
            <li>Staying away from places, activities, or people that remind you of a traumatic event.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Negative Changes in Thinking and Mood</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Negative thoughts about yourself, other people, or the world.</li>
            <li>Ongoing negative emotions of fear, blame, guilt, anger, or shame.</li>
            <li>Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of a traumatic event.</li>
            <li>Feeling detached from family and friends.</li>
            <li>Not being interested in activities you once enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Having a hard time feeling positive emotions.</li>
            <li>Feeling emotionally numb.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Changes in Physical and Emotional Reactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Being easily startled or frightened.</li>
            <li>Always being on guard for danger.</li>
            <li>Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast.</li>
            <li>Trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li>Trouble concentrating.</li>
            <li>Irritability, angry outbursts, or aggressive behavior.</li>
            <li>Physical reactions, such as sweating, rapid breathing, fast heartbeat, or shaking.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
        <p>Talk to your healthcare professional or a mental health professional if you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, especially if they're severe. Also, see a health professional if you're having trouble getting your life back under control. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.</p>
        
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>You can develop PTSD when you go through, see, or learn about an event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual assault. Factors contributing to PTSD may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extremely stressful experiences and severity of trauma.</li>
            <li>Inherited mental health risks, such as a family history of anxiety and depression.</li>
            <li>Personality traits (temperament).</li>
            <li>Brain chemistry and stress response regulation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>After surviving a traumatic event, timely help and support may prevent usual stress reactions from worsening into PTSD. This may include seeking support from family, friends, or mental health professionals, and avoiding unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance misuse.</p>
