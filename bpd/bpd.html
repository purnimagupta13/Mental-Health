        <h2>Understanding Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <p>Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is a mental health condition marked by extreme mood swings. These swings include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). While hypomania is less severe than mania, both can significantly impact daily life.</p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms vary based on the type of episode:</p>
        <h3>Mania and Hypomania</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased energy or activity levels</li>
            <li>Exaggerated self-confidence</li>
            <li>Reduced need for sleep</li>
            <li>Rapid speech and racing thoughts</li>
            <li>Easily distracted</li>
            <li>Engaging in risky behaviors, such as spending sprees or unsafe decisions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Major Depressive Episode</h3>
        <p>A depressive episode includes symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily life. Symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling sad, hopeless, or tearful</li>
            <li>Loss of interest in activities</li>
            <li>Changes in weight or appetite</li>
            <li>Sleeping too much or too little</li>
            <li>Fatigue or low energy</li>
            <li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</li>
            <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
            <li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bipolar I Disorder:</strong> Involves at least one manic episode, possibly followed by hypomanic or depressive episodes. Severe mania may lead to psychosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Bipolar II Disorder:</strong> Includes at least one major depressive episode and one hypomanic episode, but no manic episodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Cyclothymia:</strong> Involves periods of hypomania and depression lasting at least two years, though symptoms are less severe.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Types:</strong> Bipolar-like symptoms triggered by medical conditions or substance use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
        <p>If you experience symptoms of bipolar disorder, consult a mental health professional. Left untreated, bipolar disorder can disrupt your work, relationships, and overall quality of life. Emergency care is essential for thoughts of self-harm or suicide.</p>

        <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>While the exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, contributing factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Biological differences:</strong> Brain structure and function changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> A family history of bipolar disorder increases risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Stress or trauma:</strong> Life events like loss or abuse can trigger episodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Substance misuse:</strong> Drugs and alcohol may worsen symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>While bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, effective treatments can help manage symptoms. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants as prescribed by a healthcare provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychotherapy:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or other counseling approaches to develop coping strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Adjustments:</strong> Regular routines, stress management, and sufficient sleep can reduce mood swings.</li>
        </ul>
