        <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
        <p>ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a mental health condition that affects focus, impulse control, and activity levels. It can impact daily life, including work, school, and relationships.</p>

        <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
        <p>People with ADHD may experience symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Symptoms vary depending on the type of ADHD.</p>

        <h2>Types of ADHD</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Predominantly Inattentive:</strong> Difficulty focusing, completing tasks, and following instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive:</strong> Excessive movement, interrupting others, and difficulty waiting for turns.</li>
            <li><strong>Combined Type:</strong> Features both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes of ADHD</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>Environmental toxins, such as lead exposure.</li>

                <li>Premature birth or low birth weight.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>ADHD diagnosis involves observing symptoms over time, gathering input from caregivers or teachers, and ruling out other conditions. Doctors may use checklists and rating scales for assessment.</p>

        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>Several factors can increase the risk of ADHD, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Having blood relatives with ADHD.</li>
            <li>Exposure to environmental toxins.</li>
            <li>Premature birth or low birth weight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Therapies:</strong> Behavioral therapy and psychotherapy can help manage symptoms and develop coping strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Stimulants (e.g., Adderall, Ritalin) and non-stimulants (e.g., Strattera) are commonly prescribed.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong> Regular exercise, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and structured routines can be beneficial.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Avoid alcohol, drugs, and smoking during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Protect children from exposure to toxins like lead paint.</li>
            <li>Limit screen time, especially in the first five years of life.</li>
        </ul>
