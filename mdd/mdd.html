            <p>Depression, also referred to as clinical depression or major depressive disorder, is a medical condition that is classified as a mood disorder. It can affect how you feel and your ability to function on a day-to-day basis.</p>
            <p>While everyone tends to feel sad or low from time to time, feeling that way for weeks or months at a time could mean you have depression.</p>
            <p>If you suspect you may have depression, you’re not alone. Over 8% of adults living in the United States have experienced at least one major depressive episode.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Major Depressive Disorder</h2>
            <p>The exact causes of major depressive disorder are not fully understood, but experts believe that several different factors contribute to its onset. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biochemistry:</strong> Differences in brain chemical levels can make you more prone to depression. While chemical imbalances are not the primary cause, neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine play important roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Having a relative with depression increases your chances of developing it. However, the interaction of genetic and environmental factors determines the risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Medical History:</strong> A history of depression increases the likelihood of future episodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Women are twice as likely to develop depression, partly due to hormonal and social factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Events:</strong> Trauma, loss, and major changes can trigger depression, especially if experienced in childhood.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Physical and mental stress can elevate the risk of depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Lack of support and social withdrawal can contribute to depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Depression can accompany chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Certain medications, such as anticonvulsants and corticosteroids, can have depression as a side effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Substances:</strong> Alcohol and drugs can cause or worsen depression, though they are sometimes used as coping mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Personality:</strong> Traits like high neuroticism and low extraversion may increase vulnerability to depression.</li>
            </ul>
