            <p>Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being. However, terms like <strong>mental illness</strong> and <strong>mental disorder</strong> are often used interchangeably, which can lead to confusion. While they are closely related, there are distinctions between the two concepts. This article aims to clarify these differences.</p>
            <p>According to the American Heritage Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, a mental disorder refers to a disturbance of the normal physical or mental health of the mind. Mental disorders are an outdated term that dates back to prior understandings of mental health. In earlier studies, it was believed that mental disorders only impacted the mind, but today the medical community understands that mental disorders not only affect the mind, body, but also the brain and overall functioning of the individual. Today, mental illness is used more widely to describe a person’s mental wellbeing.</p>

            <h2>What is Mental Illness?</h2>
            <p>Mental illness refers to a range of health conditions that affect your mood, thinking, and behavior. In the United States, it is estimated that about 1 in 4 adults experience a diagnosed mental illness each year. Not only will mental illness affect the way you think and feel, but it can change how you interact with others. Many people experience mental health concerns from time to time, but individuals should seek help when ongoing signs and symptoms begin to cause frequent stress and affect their ability to function.</p>
            <p>Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depression</li>
                <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
                <li>Bipolar disorder</li>
                <li>Schizophrenia</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These conditions are typically diagnosed based on specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Mental illnesses often require clinical intervention, such as therapy or medication, to manage symptoms effectively.</p>

            <h2>What is a Mental Disorder?</h2>
            <p>A mental disorder is a broader term that encompasses a variety of mental health conditions, including mental illnesses. It refers to any condition that disrupts a person’s thoughts, emotions, or behaviors to the extent that it impairs their ability to function in daily life. This can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder)</li>
                <li>Neurocognitive disorders (e.g., dementia)</li>
                <li>Substance use disorders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Not all mental disorders are classified as illnesses. Some may arise from temporary or situational factors and may not require long-term clinical treatment.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Mental illness is a subset of mental disorders, while mental disorder is a broader category.</li>
                <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Mental illnesses are often more severe and require clinical intervention, whereas some mental disorders may be less severe or temporary.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Depression is a mental illness, whereas adjustment disorder (stress response syndrome) is a mental disorder but not necessarily an illness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
